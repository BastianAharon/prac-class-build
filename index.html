<p>My aunt brought felix when I was 7 years old we had only had dogs before that so having a bird was something I had never experience before. So just trying to get him say things like Good morning,Good aftertoon and Hi. He was such a pretty bird would spend most of his time whistling and eating bird seeds. Sadly he passed away after being with us for five years i miss him so much to this day.</p>
